🩺 Medical Chatbot Powered by LLMs, LangChain, Pinecone, Flask & AWS
This project is a full-stack implementation of an intelligent medical chatbot that leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) and LangChain for natural language understanding, Pinecone for vector-based memory retrieval, and Flask for a lightweight web interface. It’s designed to deliver accurate, context-aware responses to medical queries—making it a powerful tool for healthcare support and education.

🚀 Features
- Conversational AI: Built on GPT and LangChain for dynamic, human-like interactions.
- Semantic Search: Uses Pinecone to retrieve relevant medical information from embedded documents.
- Web Interface: Flask-based frontend for seamless user interaction.
- Secure Deployment: Fully containerized and deployable on AWS using EC2, ECR, and GitHub Actions.
- Scalable Architecture: Easily extendable to support more domains or integrate with other APIs.
